We have added a new functionality to WildFly Elytron

It is now possible to configure security realms that delegate authentication and authorization to multiple realms.

== Distributed realm

First added realm is the `distributed-realm`, which can be used to join multiple realms into one, for example if you
have user data on two databases. Unlike `aggregate-realm`, which uses one realm for authentication and multiple realms
or authorization, `distributed-realm` uses multiple realms for both authentication and authorization.


Lets say we have two realms called `realm1` and `realm2`, which we want to use as one. We can do so in CLI using following command:

[source]
----
/subsystem=elytron/distributed-realm=newrealm:add(realms=[realm1, realm2])
----

which results in following configuration:

[source,xml]
----
<security-realms>
...
    <distributed-realm name="newrealm" realms="realm1 realm2"/>
...
</security-realms>
----

The new distributed-realm `newrealm` will use both `realm1` and `realm2` for authentication and authorization.


== Failover realm

The other added realm is the `failover-realm`, which enables you to configure a backup realm in case another realm is
unavailable. For example, we can have a file based as a backup for database realm,
so we can still access the deployed application using backup identity stored in the file based realm,
even if we lose network connection to the `jdbc-realm` database.

Lets say we have user data in jdbc-realm called `realm1` and we want to use filesystem-realm called `realm2` as a backup.
We can do this in CLI using following command:

[source]
----
/subsystem=elytron/failover-realm=newrealm:add(delegate-realm=realm1, failover-realm=realm2)
----

which results in following configuration:

[source,xml]
----
<security-realms>
...
    <failover-realm name="newrealm" delegate-realm="realm1" failover-realm="realm2"/>
...
</security-realms>
----

The new failover-realm `newrealm` will use `realm1` as a primary realm for authentication and authorization, but if the
realm becomes unavailable, it will switch to using `realm2`. The failover happens per authentication, so if the `realm1` becomes
unavailable for a short time, you will be able to authenticate using it as soon as it comes back up without any reloads.
